## JSON COLLAPSE

A reusable UI component that retrieves JSON data from a given URL and shows it in a tree view where nodes can be expanded and collapsed.\
The heart of this UI component lies within the 'RecursiveMenu' functional component, which accepts an object, and calls it's inner recursiveMenuFunc function with that object.
